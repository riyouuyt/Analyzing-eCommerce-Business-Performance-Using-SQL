# Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-Using-SQL

## Project Objective:
In a company, measuring business performance is crucial for tracking, combining, and assessing the success or failure of various business processes. This project aims to analyze the business performance of an eCommerce company by considering several key business metrics, namely customer growth, product quality, and payment type.

## Tools:
- **PostgreSQL (RDBMS):** Database Analysis

## **Dataset Information:**
  The datasets used in this project are provided by Rakamin. They are included in a zip file, and you can find more information about the dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dWjSI8HfJgllzcUttcK2YDeSWYaM3Aw_?usp=drive_link).

  By systematically employing these tools to analyze the datasets stored in PostgreSQL, this project will offer valuable insights into the performance of the eCommerce business. These insights will guide strategic decisions to optimize customer growth, enhance product quality, and streamline payment processes, ultimately contributing to the company's overall success and competitiveness in the digital marketplace.

## Data Preparation:
In the data preparation phase, we followed two crucial steps:

  ### 1. Table Creation:
We created the necessary tables using SQL queries to structure the data. These tables will serve as the foundation for our analysis.

  ### 2. Data Import:
We imported the data into these tables using the COPY command within PostgreSQL's psql tool. This process involved organizing and assembling essential datasets, including Seller, Customer, Order Items, Order Payment, Geolocation, Product, Order Review, and Order datasets.

This meticulous data preparation lays the groundwork for our comprehensive analysis of eCommerce business performance, enabling us to derive actionable insights from the collected information.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
The next critical step in our project is the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram will visually represent how the tables are interconnected, providing a deeper understanding of the relationships between different aspects of our eCommerce business data. The ERD will play a pivotal role in facilitating comprehensive data analysis and informed decision-making in the subsequent stages of our project.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to analyze and enhance eCommerce business performance using SQL.
